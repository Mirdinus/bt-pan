# bt-pan
Automation of backup bluetooth PAN (mainly for Raspberry Pi)

## Original work
__Original work done by @logan-gunthorpe over at [Stack Exchange](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/29504/how-can-i-set-up-a-bluetooth-pan-connection-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-an-ipod#71587)__

## Installation

### Standart way
  * `git clone https://github.com/Mirdinus/bt-pan`
  * `cd github.com bt-pan`
  * `bash provision.sh`

### One-liner
  * `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Mirdinus/bt-pan/master/provision.sh)"`





_P.S. I'm just doing a lot of rebuilds and bt-pan is my prefered way of getting a wireless backup connection to the RPi_
